# UCL-API-Hack-2020

This repo contains our UCL API Hack 2020 group's project.

We made an all-in-one app to tie all society info and events into one place with that goal that it would have some extra features that Facebook and the UCL Students Union website alone don't have.

We made it using a React front end and an Express back end querying a MySQL database.
